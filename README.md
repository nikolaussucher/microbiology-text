# Text For Microbiology

This is an open source, open educational resource (OER) text that I am  developing for SCI204 the Microbiology course at [Roxbury Community College](http://www.rcc.mass.edu) in Boston, Massachusetts. This course explores the history, scope, classification, growth, identification, genetics, and metabolism of microorganisms.  Host-parasite interactions, immunology, and some bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases are discussed.

I am developing this text as [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) but license it under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) United States License because I love [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) from which I mostly compiled this text.

On the technology side, I got started by cloning Yihui Xie's [rstudio/bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) site. I discovered bookdown because after reading Garrett Grolemund's and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), which is a pleasure to read on any screen including the mobile phone.

The current current version of this text is available [here](https://nikolaussucher.github.io/microbiology-text/).
