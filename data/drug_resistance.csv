Mechanism,Antimicrobial Agent,Drug  Action,Mechanism of Resistance
Destroy drug,Aminoglycoside Beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin and cephalosporin) Chloramphenicol,"Binds to 30S Ribosome subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis Binds to penicillin-binding proteins, Inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis Bind to 50S ribosome subunit, inhibiting formation of peptide bonds","Plasmid encode enzymes that chemically alter the drug (e.g., by acetylation or phosphorylation), thereby inactivating it. Plasmid encode beta-lactamase, which open the beta-lactam ring, inactivating it. Plasmid encode an enzyme that acetylate the drug, thereby inactivating it."
Alters drug target,Aminoglycosides Beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin and cephalosporin) Erythromycin Quinolones Rifampin Trimethoprim,"Binds to 30S Ribosome subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis Binds to penicillin-binding proteins, Inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis Bind to 50S ribosome subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis Binds to DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis Binds to the RNA polymerase; inhibiting initiation of RNA synthesis Inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reduces, blocking the folic acid pathway","Bacteria make an altered 30S ribosomes that does not bind to the drug. Bacteria make an altered  penicillin-binding proteins,  that do not bind to the drug. Bacteria make a form of 50S ribosome that does not binds to the drug. Bacteria make an altered DNA topoisomerase that does not binds to the drug. Bacteria make an altered polymerase that does not binds to the drug. Bacteria make an altered  enzyme that does not binds to the drug."
Inhibits drug entry or removes drug,Penicillin Erythromycin Tetracycline,"Binds to penicillin-binding proteins, Inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis Bind to 50S ribosome subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis Binds to 30S Ribosome subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis by blocking tRNA","Bacteria change shape of the outer membrane porin proteins, preventing drug from entering cell. New membrane transport system prevent drug from entering cell. New membrane transport system pumps drug out of cell."
