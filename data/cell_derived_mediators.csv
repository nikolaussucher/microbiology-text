Lysosome granules,Enzymes,Granulocytes,"These cells contain a large variety of enzymes that perform a number of functions. Granules can be classified as either specific or azurophilic depending upon the contents, and are able to break down a number of substances, some of which may be plasma-derived proteins that allow these enzymes to act as inflammatory mediators."
GM-CSF,Glycoprotein,"Macrophages, monocytes, T-cells, B-cells, and tissue-resident cells","Elevated GM-CSF has been shown to contribute to inflammation in inflammatory arthritis, osteoarthritis, colitis asthma, obesity, and COVID-19."
Histamine,Monoamine,Mast cells and basophils,"Stored in preformed granules, histamine is released in response to a number of stimuli. It causes arteriole dilation, increased venous permeability, and a wide variety of organ-specific effects."
IFN-γ,Cytokine,"T-cells, NK cells","Antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumour properties. This interferon was originally called macrophage-activating factor, and is especially important in the maintenance of chronic inflammation."
IL-6,Cytokine and Myokine,"Macrophages, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and smooth muscle cells (cytokine) Skeletal muscle cells (myokine)","Pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by macrophages in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by adipocytes, especially in obesity; anti-inflammatory myokine secreted by skeletal muscle cells in response to exercise."
IL-8,Chemokine,Primarily macrophages,"Activation and chemoattraction of neutrophils, with a weak effect on monocytes and eosinophils."
Leukotriene B4,Eicosanoid,"Leukocytes, cancer cells","Able to mediate leukocyte adhesion and activation, allowing them to bind to the endothelium and migrate across it. In neutrophils, it is also a potent chemoattractant, and is able to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species and the release of lysosomal enzymes by these cells."
"LTC4, LTD4",Eicosanoid,"eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages","These three Cysteine-containing leukotrienes contract lung airways, increase micro-vascular permeability, stimulate mucus secretion, and promote eosinophil-based inflammation in the lung, skin, nose, eye, and other tissues."
5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid,Eicosanoid,"leukocytes, cancer cells","Potent stimulator of neutrophil chemotaxis, lysosome enzyme release, and reactive oxygen species formation; monocyte chemotaxis; and with even greater potency eosinophil chemotaxis, lysosome enzyme release, and reactive oxygen species formation."
5-HETE,Eicosanoid,Leukocytes,"Metabolic precursor to 5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, it is a less potent stimulator of neutrophil chemotaxis, lysosome enzyme release, and reactive oxygen species formation; monocyte chemotaxis; and eosinophil chemotaxis, lysosome enzyme release, and reactive oxygen species formation."
Prostaglandins,Eicosanoid,Mast cells,"A group of lipids that can cause vasodilation, fever, and pain."
Nitric oxide,Soluble gas,"Macrophages, endothelial cells, some neurons","Potent vasodilator, relaxes smooth muscle, reduces platelet aggregation, aids in leukocyte recruitment, direct antimicrobial activity in high concentrations."
TNF-α and IL-1,Cytokines,Primarily macrophages,"Both affect a wide variety of cells to induce many similar inflammatory reactions: fever, production of cytokines, endothelial gene regulation, chemotaxis, leukocyte adherence, activation of fibroblasts. Responsible for the systemic effects of inflammation, such as loss of appetite and increased heart rate. TNF-α inhibits osteoblast differentiation."
Tryptase,Enzymes,Mast Cells,"This serine protease is believed to be exclusively stored in mast cells and secreted, along with histamine, during mast cell activation.[20][21][22]"
